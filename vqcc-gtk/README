1. What is vqcc-gtk
----------------------------------
Vqcc-gtk is a chat application written in C for the GTK+ toolkit, primarily
used in small LAN's. Based on quickChat/Vypress Chat (TM) for Windows
(from Vypress Research) and is licensed under the GPL.

The application supports both quickChat and Vypress Chat(TM) protocols and
hopefully is compatible enough to substitute those applications when using
Linux, FreeBSD or any other *NIX desktop. You need no server to run, however
it is not possible to communicate outside your LAN (or subnet).

2. Support for MS Windows
----------------------------------
<<To be written>>

3. Building off the CVS repository
----------------------------------
In order to compile the package from cvs you'll need:
	* make (almost any version);
	* automake-1.5 +;
	* autoconf-2.53 +;
	* development packages for glib-2.x and gtk-2.x;
	* a decent C compiler toolset (preferably GCC);

Just run the `./autogen.sh' and then `make'. You may need to modify
./configure parameters in autogen.sh as it may not be prepared for your
system configuration.

4. FAQ
----------------------------------
Q: What does the name "vqcc-gtk" stands for?
A: It was conceived as (V)ypresschat & (Q)uick(C)hat (C)lient for the GTK+
   toolkit. Kinda weird, but all the good names are taken already(tm).

Q: GNOME (or GTK+) sucks, I prefer KDE (QT).
A: Take a look at VyQChat (http://www.nongnu.org/vyqchat/) which is a clean
   QT application.
